## Introduction

- Welcome to the Yoga Class Admission Form application! This project is a simple web-based solution for managing admissions to monthly yoga classes. The application allows users to fill out an admission form, choose a batch, and make monthly payments. The backend is implemented in Node.js with Express, and the data is stored in a MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Frontend part

- The main HTML file is index.html, which includes the form elements for user registration. The form captures essential information such as name, age, selected month, and preferred batch. The user is required to fill out the form to enroll in the yoga classes.
- Form validation is implemented using JavaScript in script.js. The submitForm function is triggered when the user clicks the "Pay Rs. 500" button. It performs the following validations:
    - **Age Validation**: Ensures that the user's age is within the specified range of 18 to 65 years.

    - **Batch Validation**: Checks if the selected batch is valid. Valid batches include "6-7AM," "7-8AM," "8-9AM," and "5-6PM."

If any validation fails, an alert message is displayed to notify the user of the error.

## Making API Calls

- After successful validation, the form data is prepared and sent to the server using a fetch API call. The backend API endpoint `/api/register` is targeted with a POST request, and the form data is sent in JSON format. The response from the server is then processed, and appropriate alerts are displayed based on the success or failure of the registration and payment process.
- This **`/api/* http://13.232.69.5:3000/:splat 200`** is the actual redirect path so that actual url will be **`http://13.232.69.5:3000/register`**
